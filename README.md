# Project Description

This project is all about the frontend part of our blog application made with use of React and Typescript.

# Challenges Faced and Approach
I successfully fetch the data from backend using fetch and store in useState but when I use Typescript in state for the 
data type it gave me error but finally solved it. 

Another challenge was setting react router setup and get the id of blog

# Additional Feature
I have used tailwind css so no more css files and also improved the overall UI and added loading indicator
